# Data Visualization Demo

## Dash Applications
There are 2 Dash applications in the project:
- app.py is a good example of a dashboard with interconnected components
- app_map.py is a bit less elaborate, but includes a map graph


To see the apps:
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/cedricgoubard/dataviz_demo.git`
- Enter the project `cd dataviz_demo`
- Create a virtual environment - `python -m venv venv`
- Activate it - `source venv/bin/activate` (unix) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Install the required modules - `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Lauch the app - `python app.py` or `python app_map.py`
- [Check out the result](http://127.0.0.1:8050)
